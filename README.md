Licensing.   Answer the following questions:
1. If we are consider using a toolkit like FlexNet (aka FlexLm), where would we put the calls 
to initialize the license server?   Would this approach be too heavy handed for your 
application, if yes why?
2. Another alternative, could be an DRM like approach, where some type of hash\key is 
stored on the computer that indicates what is allowed.  Would this approach be better.  
This is like the model of steam, entering in a product key, and so on.
c. If your boss\product manager told you to think about having multiple licenses for 
different functionality (instead of monolithic, but more atomic).  How you would you 
suggest to organizing the entitlements (i.e. what pieces of functionality to have against 
what license)?
